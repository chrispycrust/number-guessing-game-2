<!-- 
    brief 
    
    I want you to create a simple guess the number type game. 
    It should choose a random number between 1 and 100, 
    then challenge the player to guess the number in 10 turns. 
    After each turn, the player should be told if they are right or wrong, 
    and if they are wrong, whether the guess was too low or too high. 
    It should also tell the player what numbers they previously guessed. 
    The game will end once the player guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns. 
    When the game ends, the player should be given an option to start playing again.

    psuedocode

    computer chooses random number between 1-100 when page loads
    initialise turn counter at 0
    event: user types into the text field, presses submit guess
    must type a number between 1-100, however numbers outside the range seems to be allowed
    increase turn count by 1
    append record of user guess to paragraph "previous guesses"
    create message space: wrong! correct! 
    create message notifying whether the guess is higher or lower than computer's chosen number
    text field empties to prepare for new guess

    terminate game when:
        player guess a number that matches the computer's chosen number
        the turn counter reaches 10 and the guesses have not been correct
    starting a new game
    Deactivate text field
    provide button that says "start a new game"
